[![Deploy](https://github.com/UnrelatedString/44ko/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/UnrelatedString/44ko/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

A bare-bones manga reader designed to automatically parse panels out from the page and separate / hide them as desired. No more fighting to keep your eyes off the next 4koma strip!

Kinda probably inspired by cubari.moe
